Questionnaire:

1. A PCB is a circuit board with none of thew work done on it, so it is a blank board. A PCBA is a commpleted board with everything put onto it already after being designed.

2. A PCB stencil is a piece of metal that has openings to help with the soldering process used to attatch components.

3. Gerber files are a type of files that hold the information of each layer of a designed PCB.

4. A pick and place file is an input data file that is used for the automated assembly process of a PCB.

5. Cross talk is a twisted pair cables that are used for data transmission. Increasing the distance between the cables is a good way to avoid cross talk.

6. They should be placed as closely as possible to the power and ground pins in order to avoid any parasitic inductance.

7. STM32L4 has three internal clock sources.

8. A boot loader is a program that puts the operating system into memory for the computer to boot off of.

9. SWD is an ARM protocol that is used for micro debugging. JTAG is another debugging tool that is used more widely and by non-ARM micros.

10. JTAG is better suited for more complex systems while SWD is better suited for micros with limited resources.
